# GitHub-Archive-Workaround

Note taking archives in GitHub is available now, but in mid-2016 it wasn't. This is just a small piece of sample code I wrote as a test to show, mostly myself, that implementing this capability was rather straightforward.

What follows was the original documenation:
> This is a Python script to download an archive of the current tip of master for a GitHub repository or a specific subdirectory, as [git-archive](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive) would do [if it was supported](https://help.github.com/articles/can-i-archive-a-repository/) by GitHub.
